# AIDA_Project

## Setup

Run `python -m venv .venv` and then activate the virtual environment (different based on OS). Then install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Create a file `.env` and set TIINGO_API_TOKEN="token".

`pip freeze > requirements.txt` will write your dependencies to a file, which you and others can use to easily install your dependencies.
